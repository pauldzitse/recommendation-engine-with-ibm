## 1. Description

This Project is one of the Data Science Nanodegree Program of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/school-of-data-science) in collaboration with [IBM Watson Studio](https://www.ibm.com/watson). We analysed the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform and make recommendations to them about new articles we identify that might be of interest to them.

Following approaches were taken:
  
-	Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the dataset.
- Rank Based Recommendations: building recommendation based on most popular articles.
-	User-User Based Collaborative Filtering: building recommendation based on similar user-items interaction.
-	Matrix Factorization: using machine learning approach to building recommendations. 
-	Discuss the outcome of the analysis and make recommendations
